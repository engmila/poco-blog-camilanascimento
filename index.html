            <h2>Welcome to my Powercoders Blog!</h2>
            <p>Here you can find my work at the Powercoders Programm 2/2020</p>
            <p>Powercoders Programm 2/2020 started with the preparation weeks on 10th of August/2020,
                and the Bootcamp started on 7th of September/2020.</p>
            <section id="aboutme">
                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I was born in Brazil on November 22, 1984, I grew up in the city of Brasilia, capital of Brazil, with my family. Since I was a teenager 
                    I always liked computers and I had my first contact with programming at 16 years old, that's when I learned HTML.</p>
                <p>In 2003, I started the university of Computer Engineering. In 2008, I finished college and I went to live in Australia to study English,
                    and I took the Microsoft certification course, MCPD (Microsoft Certified Professional Developer), so I started
                    programming with c#, .NET and met Microsoft Visual Studio.
                    I have three years of experience with c#, .NET and sql server development.</p>	
                <p>In 2014, I met my boyfriend at the soccer world cup in Brazil, he's from Switzerland. And in 2016 I moved to Switzerland, where I live today.
                    Since I moved to Switzerland I have dedicated myself to learning German, I have the TELC certificate in German level B1.</p>	
                <p>At the moment I have dedicated myself to learn more about web development, I have studied HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Angular and Dynamics 365.
                    In August 2020, I joined the Powercoders program and I'm very excited about Bootcamp, which will take place from September to December 2020.</p>
